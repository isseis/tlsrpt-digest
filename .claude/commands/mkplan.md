Your goal is to create `03_implementation_plan.md` for one task under `docs/tasks/`.

Work in the following order.

1. Identify the target task directory by following the rules in `docs/dev/developer_guide/task_identification.md`.

2. Read `02_architecture.md` in the target task directory.

3. Verify that implementation planning is allowed.
- Check the document status in `02_architecture.md`.
- If the status is not `approved`, do not create `03_implementation_plan.md`.
- In that case, stop and report that implementation planning cannot begin until `02_architecture.md` is `approved`.

4. Read the remaining required input documents.
- `01_requirements.md` in the target task directory
- `docs/dev/developer_guide/requirements_process.md`
- `docs/dev/developer_guide/test_organization.md`

5. Inspect the current codebase before writing the plan.
- Check the relevant packages, tests, and test helpers under `cmd/` and `internal/`.
- Identify existing functions, tests, and helper utilities that should be reused.
- Do not plan to re-implement logic or add duplicate tests when the repository already has suitable coverage or reusable helpers.

6. Create `03_implementation_plan.md` in the same task directory.
- Write in Japanese.
- Set the document status to `draft`.
- Include all required sections defined in `docs/dev/developer_guide/requirements_process.md`.
- Organize work into small, phase-based steps with checkboxes.
- Explicitly map each acceptance criterion to the tasks and tests that will verify it.
- Include at least one concrete test task for each acceptance criterion.
- Reference the architecture document instead of duplicating design details.
- Include specific file paths to modify where they can be identified confidently.
- Keep tasks actionable, observable, and small enough to complete and verify.

7. Apply test helper planning rules from `docs/dev/developer_guide/test_organization.md`.
- If new cross-package helpers or mocks are needed, plan them under `testutil/` with the correct file naming and package naming rules.
- If package-internal helpers are needed, plan them as `test_helpers.go` or `test_helpers_<category>.go` with `//go:build test`.
- Do not add helper files in the plan unless they are actually needed.

8. Review the document end to end and fix any issues you find before finishing.

**Technical correctness checklist:**
- [ ] `02_architecture.md` is `approved`.
- [ ] `03_implementation_plan.md` is written in Japanese and its status is `draft`.
- [ ] All required sections from the requirements process guide are present.
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion in `01_requirements.md` is addressed by at least one implementation task.
- [ ] The plan includes an explicit acceptance criteria verification section.
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion has at least one concrete test task.
- [ ] Test tasks cover non-trivial logic, error paths, and boundary values where applicable.
- [ ] The plan does not duplicate tests or re-test behavior that existing tests already cover without reason.
- [ ] The plan reuses existing implementations, tests, and helper utilities where appropriate.
- [ ] The plan references architecture sections instead of duplicating design details.
- [ ] The plan does not imply Japanese text in Go source comments, identifiers, or string literals.
- [ ] Any planned test helper files follow `docs/dev/developer_guide/test_organization.md`.
- [ ] Planned file paths are specific where known and do not conflict with existing package responsibilities.

**Readability and consistency checklist:**
- [ ] Terminology is consistent with `02_architecture.md`; the same concept always uses the same Japanese term.
- [ ] Task descriptions are phrased as clear, actionable instructions. Vague verbs (e.g., "対応する", "実装する") are replaced with specific actions where possible.
- [ ] Redundant or repetitive content is removed; design details already in the architecture document are referenced rather than restated.
- [ ] Ambiguous or overly terse expressions are rewritten in direct, plain Japanese so readers do not need prior context to understand what is expected.

When finished, provide a concise summary of what you created and any assumptions you had to make. If your runtime instructions allow committing at this stage, commit with an English commit message after the review is complete.
